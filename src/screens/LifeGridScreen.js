				    		This is my take on the post <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">Your Life in Weeks</a> by 
				    		Tim Urban of Wait But Why. If you haven't read it yet, take the next 10 minutes and do yourself a huge favor. Your future self 
				    		will thank you! 
				    	</p>
				    	<p>
				    		Also, they sell a <a href="https://store.waitbutwhy.com/collections/life-calendars" target="_blank">physical "Life Calendar"</a> that you can fill in however you want <strong>IRL</strong>. I own one and it will continue 
				    		to exist long after this website disappears, after the whole internet is gone, and after our cat-alien overlords enslave us all 
				    		into a life of pet-servitude. So go <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">check it out!</a>
				    	</p>
				    	<p>
				    		Okay, you're back? Great! Let's get started.
				    	</p>

				    	<h3>What's a life calendar?</h3>
				    	<p>
				    		It helps you make sense of this crazy precious gift we've all been given, and hopefully help you make better choices about 
				    		how to use it.
				    	</p>

				    	<h3>But how...? ðŸ¤”</h3>
				    	<p>
				    		Life is both long and far too short; you need perspective. To quote Tim Urban in <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">the article you just read</a> (right?!)

				    		<blockquote>One of the ways we end up in NeitherLand* is by not thinking about things hard enoughâ€”so one of the most critical skills is continual reflection and self-awareness.</blockquote>
				    		
				    		The Life Calendar is a tool that helps you do that more easily and actually enjoy doing it.

				    	</p>
				    	<small>*Neitherland is where you're neither enjoying the now nor setting yourself up to enjoy the future more.</small>
