		    	<h2>Rethinking your life, one week at a time</h2>
		    	<p>
		    		This is my take on the post <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Life in Weeks</a> by 
		    		Tim Urban of Wait But Why. If you haven't read it yet, take the next 10 minutes and do yourself a huge favor. Your future self 
		    		will thank you! 
		    	</p>
		    	<p>
		    		Also, they sell a <a href="https://store.waitbutwhy.com/collections/life-calendars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical "Life Calendar"</a> that you can fill in however you want <strong>IRL</strong>. I own one and it will continue 
		    		to exist long after this website disappears, after the whole internet is gone, and after our cat-alien overlords enslave us all 
		    		into a life of pet-servitude. So go <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check it out!</a>

		    		Okay, you're back? Great! Let's get started.

		    	<h3>What's a life calendar?</h3>
		    	<p>
		    		It helps you make sense of this crazy precious gift we've all been given, and hopefully help you make better choices about 
		    		how to use it.

		    		Life is both long and far too short - to do it well, you need perspective. To quote Tim Urban in <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Life in Weeks</a>

		    		<blockquote><em>One of the ways we end up in NeitherLand* is by not thinking about things hard enoughâ€”so one of the most critical skills is continual reflection and self-awareness.</em></blockquote>
		    		
		    		The Life Calendar is a tool that helps you do that more easily and actually enjoy doing it.
