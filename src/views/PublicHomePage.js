		    		This is my take on the post <Anchor href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Life in Weeks</Anchor> by 
		    		Tim Urban of Wait But Why. If you haven't read it yet, take the next 10 minutes and do yourself a huge favor. Your future self 
		    		will thank you! 
		    	</p>
		    	<p>
		    		They also sell a <Anchor href="https://store.waitbutwhy.com/collections/life-calendars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical "Life Calendar"</Anchor> that you can fill in however you want <strong>IRL</strong>. I own one and it will continue 
		    		to exist long after this website disappears, after the whole internet is gone, and after our cat-alien overlords enslave us all 
		    		into a life of pet-servitude. So go <Anchor href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check it out!</Anchor>

		    		Life is both long and far too short - to do it well, you need perspective. To quote Tim Urban in <Anchor href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Life in Weeks</Anchor>

		    	<blockquote className="athelas ml0 mt0 pl3 black-90 bl bw2 b--blue">One of the ways we end up in NeitherLand* is by not thinking about things hard enoughâ€”so one of the most critical skills is continual reflection and self-awareness.</blockquote>
		    	<p className="f6 athelas">*Neitherland is where you're neither enjoying the now nor setting yourself up to enjoy the future more. You want to avoid NeitherLand.</p>
		    	<p>	
		    		The Life Calendar is a tool that helps you do that more easily and actually enjoy doing it.

		    		Give it a try!
